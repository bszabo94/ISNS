# ISNS
## Interpreter for Simple Neuron-network Simulations

ISNS is an interpreter made as part of my diploma work. It was written in C++, using the relatively new C++ runtime library of antlr4.
You can use the makefile included in the repository to compile the sources. The antlr4 runtime library and C++14 are the only dependencies. For the former, visit the [github page of antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4), and follow the instructions there to install it.

*More information about the language, as well as example codes will be uploaded within a few days.*
